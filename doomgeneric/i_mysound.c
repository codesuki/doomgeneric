// SDL plays audio on a separate thread. So the game registers audio to play and
// the thread will pick it up and play it.
// Since I don't have threads I would like doom to issue an 'emit audio' every
// frame.
// On the other hand.. doom already emits audio every frame. How is this synced?
// I would assume during frame the data that doom sends is queued up and mixed
// and at the end of the frame, similar to render it's output.
// I guess it works like this:
// The sound system (kernel) writes data to the sound card every N ms.
// If there is no data it does nothing.
// Now's the question, when does the mixer mix?
// Assume I start a sound on channel 1 and another sound on channel 2.. I don't
// know how many more sounds will start playing. At some point we need to call
// it quits and flush to the kernel/device.

  // Perfect. We are hooked in. What do we need to do?
  // We need to mix ahead some buffers.
  // How long is a buffer? Somehow depends on the frequency.
  // - get pointer to descriptors
  // - map buffers to user space too.
  // - mix some buffers
  // - add syscall for 'set last valid buffer'
  // - call syscall

  // it would be nice if we woudln't need to call the syscall.. but for that the
  // sound stuff would need to be memory mapped.. i think there are some
  // permission bits to let user apps write to pci io ports. I want to try that.
  // ref: vol1 ch. 20
  // I would need to set the right bit in the IO map to 0. They are all zero by
  // default because I don't write the IO map. I also didn't set the IO map base
  // in the tss. I also noticed I only have one TSS. Probably every task needs
  // one.

  // for now I create a syscall because it's straight forward.

  // When do I mix? Every time it's called let's say I mix one buffer for
  // simplicity. No that might be too fast since I am called 100s of times per
  // second. I check if last - current is < 3 then I mix a buffer.

  // How do I mix? Doom issues 'PlayChannelTimed' and I register that this chunk
  // should play from now until t. chunk has buffer, length and volume. I need
  // to save how much of a chunk I already played. Every time I mix I iterate
  // over all scheduled chunks and add/multiply the waves together for however
  // long I mix in a loop. This is what I am writing to the buffer.

  // I was thinking. If 44100hz means 44100 samples per second so 441 samples
  // per ms. Let's say we make one buffer 441 samples long then each buffer is a
  // ms. Easy to think about. 60 fps is 16.6ms per frame. I don't know how much
  // fps we actually have but let's say we write 16 buffers. That would be quite
  // laggy. I guess this is why the sound should be on a separate thread. For
  // now it's ok.

  // 1ms is likely too little because it will cause an interrupt every ms. Let's
  // go with 10ms. 4410 samples. It seems the doom code wants 1024 for low
  // latency. That's around 2ms. I will ignore it. We probably need 4096 for
  // page alignment. Otherwise we waste memory?

  // case 1:
  // current = 5 and last = 10
  // no wrap, no fill, still 5 buffers available
  //
  // case 2:
  // current = 5 and last = 6
  // no wrap, fill because last < current+2
  //

  // current = 30, last = 31, need to fill, last wraps around
